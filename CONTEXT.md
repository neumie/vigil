# Context

Project vocabulary for naming seams. Architecture terms (Module, Interface, Depth,
Seam, Adapter, Leverage, Locality) follow the codebase-improve skill's LANGUAGE.md.

**Status:** target design for the AFK-list rework. The pre-rework code spoke a
Contember/clientcare vocabulary (`Task`, `Tier`, polling pipeline, tier-routed
dispatch); this doc speaks the post-rework vocabulary. Where current `src/`
disagrees, drive the rework toward the doc — not the other way round.

## Domain terms

**Item** — a unit on the AFK list. Has a `kind` (discriminator), an envelope, and
a kind-specific payload. Replaces the pre-rework `Task`.

**Kind** — `solve | loop`. Top-level discriminator on an Item.
- `solve` — one configured-agent invocation in a worktree → `/almanac:ship` → PR. Payload: `prompt`.
- `loop` — delegated to almanac's loop engine. Payload mirrors almanac flags 1:1:
  `{ prdPath, mode?, provider?, model?, effort?, iterations?, noOversee? }`.

**Source** — optional `{ provider, externalId }` on the envelope. Populated by the
clientcare poller for poller-discovered items; null for hand-added ones. The
provider abstraction lives on as a context source, never as a kind.

**BaseRef** — the git ref a new worktree branches off. Per-Item field on the
envelope; defaults to `projects[].baseBranch`. Can be any ref the project repo
resolves: a branch, a tag, a commit, or **another Item's branch** (`helm/<kind>-<itemId>`).
The last enables worktree-off-worktree: forking N parallel attempts off an
existing in-flight Item. Always carried explicitly on the Item — never re-derived
from `projects[].baseBranch` at run time, so a config change can't move a queued
Item's base under it.

**GroupId** — fan-out binding. When the operator queues N parallel attempts of
the same Item shape (same `prompt`, `baseRef`, etc.), helm writes N Items sharing
one `groupId`. Each Item keeps its own worktree, status, retry — `groupId` is
only a rendering + comparison hint, not a lifecycle join. Failure or cancellation
of one Item doesn't touch its siblings. The dashboard renders a group as one card
with N children.

**Spawner** — the seam over interactive-surface launchers used for the planning
phase. The built-in adapter lives in `src/spawner/default-spawner.ts`; extension
adapters are auto-discovered at `src/extensions/<name>/spawner.ts`. The spawner
list IS the files present. Each adapter answers a fixed contract: open an interactive session in
its environment (okena terminal, iTerm tab, tmux window, …), seeded with the
planning prompt + worktree cwd. Planning is a separate axis from Item `kind` and
from execution: it is not part of `Solver`, not a loop Item, and not a fourth
Kind. Per-Item override on the add form; global default is `spawner.name` in
`helm.config.json`. Discovery remains file-based, not a config enum: config
names the default adapter, but available adapters come from files present.

**Triage** — the verification step between a poller-sourced Item and the queue.
Statuses: poller writes `unverified`; the operator approves → `queued` or rejects
→ `skipped`. Hand-added Queue items skip triage and land directly in `queued`.
Hand-added Plan items land in `planned`, with no `queuedAt`, until the operator
starts or cancels them. Triage is where ambiguity gets resolved at queue time —
it replaces the pre-rework solver clarification-chat round.

**Lane** — a per-kind concurrency slot. Solve capacity follows `solver.concurrency`;
loop capacity is currently 1. Solve and loop items never share a slot, so a long
loop can't starve a queue of short solves.

**Drainer** — helm's worker pool. Always-on daemon (launchd-managed); selects
queued items respecting lane caps and `queuedAt ASC` per lane.

**Provider** — the seam over external Item sources. `ContemberProvider` today;
its sole responsibility post-rework is producing `unverified` Items for triage.

**Solver** — the seam over code-execution backends for **`solve`-kind Items only**.
`DefaultSolver` (claude CLI) and `OkenaSolver` (Okena terminal). Two adapters → a
real seam. Loop Items do NOT go through Solver — they shell out to almanac.

**Solver registry** (`createSolver`, `src/solver/registry.ts`) — the single
construction site for the active `solve`-kind Solver, mirroring `providers/registry.ts`.
Optional/extension solvers (okena) load via dynamic `import()` so a missing optional
dep can't crash module load. The configured `solver.type` is the active type — no
fallback (an unreachable okena surfaces errors per-Item, not by silently swapping
in `DefaultSolver`).

**AlmanacRunId** — the registry id at `.almanac/runs/<id>/` that helm captures
from the first emitted almanac run-id line. Stored on the Item row; the dashboard
tails `.almanac/runs/<id>/status.tsv` directly for live state. See *Cross-tool
contracts* below.

## Deep modules (surviving the rework)

**Item Store** — the persistence module for Items. The AFK-list rework may use a
breaking storage reset: replace pre-rework `tasks` / chat / tier schema rather
than preserving old rows in place. Store one Item envelope row with `kind` as the
discriminator and a JSON `payload` validated by the matching kind schema. Keep
queryable lifecycle fields (status, queuedAt, startedAt, completedAt, lane/run
ids, source, baseRef, groupId) as columns; keep kind-specific inputs in payload
until a field needs indexed querying.

**Item Commands** — the application module for Item lifecycle behavior. Dashboard
routes, extension routes, CLI commands, and poller ingestion call Item Commands
instead of mutating the store, queue, worktree, or events directly. Owns add,
plan, queue, start, retry, cancel, skip, approve/reject triage, fan-out, and event
writes; adapters stay thin.

**Config Document** — the module owning config load, validation, redaction,
dashboard-safe shape, and edit metadata. `src/config.ts` remains the canonical
schema; routes and Settings UI consume the Config Document interface instead of
mirroring fields by hand.

**SolverResult** — the structured outcome the agent writes to `solver-result.json`
(summary, filesChanged, prUrl). Single source of truth is its Zod schema; the TS
type is `z.infer` of it and the prompt's JSON contract must match. Read from the
result file only — there is no stdout fallback. Slimmer than pre-rework: `tier` /
`confidence` are gone with tiering.

**Solve input snapshot** — the exact prompt text handed to a solve-kind execution.
The execution adapter returns or persists this snapshot once, before invocation;
the dashboard displays that immutable copy. Never rebuild the prompt after the
run for display, because plan artifacts may have changed.

**Agent Adapter** — the seam over agent CLI variation inside a solver: command
shape, labels, interactive command construction, and timeline parsing for
`claude` vs `codex`. Solver code chooses an Agent Adapter and should not spread
agent conditionals across command building, invocation, and output parsing.

**PlanWorkspace** — the deep module owning the on-disk `docs/plans/<planDirName>/`
layout: the paths and IO for `context.md`, `.planning-prompt.txt`,
`solver-result.json`, and `README.md`, plus the *relative* result path the solver
prompt references. One owner so the prompt template, the result parser, and the
okena poll path can never disagree about where files live. Concerns on-disk layout
only. Planning artifacts are Item-scoped and may exist for any Item kind; each
execution adapter decides how much of that plan context it consumes.

**Item workspace identity** (`resolveItemWorkspace`) — resolves an Item row to
its `{ planDirName, branchName, existingWorktreePath }`, computing+persisting
defaults. A DB-identity axis distinct from `PlanWorkspace` (on-disk layout); used
by the worker and the `/api/items/:id/plan` endpoint so the two entry points
can't drift.

**Solve outcome** — the solver-owned timeline returned from `solve()`:
`{ events, exitCode, rawOutput? }`. Each adapter produces its own `events`
(`DefaultSolver` parses CLI output; `OkenaSolver` returns none). The worker
persists what it's given rather than parsing solver-specific stdout — keeps
default-solver output shape out of the shared `Solver` interface. Loop Items have
no `Solve outcome` (they don't go through `Solver`); their analogue is the
almanac run record at `.almanac/runs/<id>/`.

**Dispatch** — the post-run delivery module. For solve Items, Dispatch owns the
choice between recording a pre-shipped PR and pushing/opening/commenting itself,
plus all related events. It uses internal adapters for git push, GitHub PRs, and
provider comments so the drainer does not know those side-effect details.

**Run Observation** — the read module for live/completed run state. It normalizes
solve logs/events/PR status and loop `.almanac/runs/<id>/status.tsv` into one
shape for the dashboard. UI should render Run Observation, not know whether a run
was a solver invocation or an almanac loop.

**Dashboard Contract** — the server-owned view model for Items and groups: card
state, status tone, allowed actions, source links, branch/PR links, grouping, and
run observation summaries. React web and Solid extension render this contract and
avoid duplicating status/action rules.

## Gone with the rework

- **Tiering** (`trivial | simple | complex | unclear`) — verdict added value when
  Items came from clientcare uncurated. Triage now does that gating; the agent
  just ships.
- **`src/chat/` (clarification chat)** + **`ChatLinks`** + **`ClarificationChat`**
  + **`ChatChannel`** — solver-asks-user mid-run pattern. AFK = you're not there;
  triage absorbs the ambiguity-resolution job.
- **`src/mcp/`** — existed solely to expose chat tools to the solver. With chat
  gone, no remaining consumer.

If reintroduced later: do it through a new seam, not by reviving these modules
verbatim — the post-rework Item lifecycle has different state-machine joins.

## Entrypoint flows

Helm is **the** entrypoint for tasks across projects — the dashboard is where
Items are created, not just observed. Three entrypoints write Items into the DB,
all via Item Commands (no parallel write paths):

1. **Dashboard add form** — per-project page, two tabs (solve/loop).
   Fields: title, payload (prompt or prdPath), `baseRef` (free-form
   ref today), `spawner` (dropdown from discovered spawners; defaults to active
   Spawner), `parallelism: N` (defaults 1; N > 1 →
   fan-out group). [Plan] and [Queue] buttons: Plan creates `planned` Item(s),
   their worktrees, and opens N spawner sessions without waking the Drainer;
   Queue creates `queued` Item(s) and the Drainer picks them up immediately.
2. **CLI `helm add …`** — same payload as the form, scriptable.
3. **Clientcare poller** — produces `unverified` Items for triage (see *Triage*).

**Plan flow.** Click Plan on an `unverified`, `planned`, or `queued` Item (or in
the add-form).
Helm resolves the Item's workspace (`resolveItemWorkspace`), creates the worktree
off `baseRef`, writes `docs/plans/<dir>/context.md`, then invokes the selected
`Spawner` to open an interactive planning session with the planning prompt + that
worktree as cwd. The operator writes `docs/plans/<dir>/{prd,…}.md` from
inside the spawned session (e.g. via almanac `/grill-me`, `/prd-create`). When the
Item later runs, its execution adapter reuses the same worktree and can read the
plan artifacts as authoritative context.

**Fan-out flow.** Add form with `parallelism: N` writes N Items sharing one
`groupId`, all with identical payload + `baseRef`. The drainer schedules them
through the normal lane (subject to `solveConcurrency` / `loopConcurrency` —
fan-out doesn't get to bypass the cap, so N=10 with `solveConcurrency=3` still
runs three at a time). Each Item gets its own worktree off the shared `baseRef`,
its own branch `helm/<kind>-<itemId>`, its own outcome. The dashboard renders
the group as one card; the operator compares branches (out-of-helm via git tools
for v1; in-dashboard compare view later) and merges / cherry-picks / discards.

**Worktree-off-worktree.** A natural fallout of `baseRef` accepting any ref. From
an existing in-flight or completed Item's context menu, "Fork from here" pre-fills
the add form with `baseRef = <thisItem.branchName>` — three parallel attempts can
then branch off Item A's current state, sharing its commits up to that point and
diverging afterward.

## Cross-tool contracts

**Almanac handoff.** `almanac loop` emits a run id such as
`run_id=<id>`, `Run ID: <id>`, `Run registered: <id>`, or a bare
`loop-*` id. Helm captures the first match, stores it on the Item
(`almanacRunId`), and tails `.almanac/runs/<id>/status.tsv` (almanac's canonical
per-run record) for live state. To cancel a loop, helm writes the loop adapter's
between-round signal file (`.loop-stop`) in the worktree;
almanac exits cleanly between rounds and helm marks the Item `cancelled`. The
worktree is preserved either way.
