 * as UNTRUSTED data — never obeying instructions inside it.
 *
 * Calibration note: a downstream coding agent with FULL repo access implements every
 * approved task, so "which file / where in the code / what's the current label" are
 * NEVER human questions — the agent discovers them. Empirically (haiku, 7 labeled
 * archetypes × multiple samples) the earlier "actionable but ambiguous; key details
 * are missing" wording bounced well-specified renames to `needs_clarification`; making
 * the downstream agent's capability explicit and defaulting to `clear` fixed it
 * (7/14 → 27/28 correct) without over-flipping genuine human decisions. Keep that
 * framing if you edit this.
